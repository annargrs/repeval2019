<h2>The Third Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP</h2>
<p>General-purpose word embeddings have come a long way since the beginning
of their boom in 2013, and they are still the most widely used way of
representing words in both industrial and academic NLP systems, but the
issue of intrinsic metrics that be predictive of performance on
downstream tasks is far from being solved. Since the last RepEval there
also appeared a number of probing tasks and large extrinsic evaluation
datasets for sentence representations, but there is still much to learn
about what features make a compositional representation successful. Last
but not the least, there are no established intrinsic methods for newer
kinds of representations such as ELMO, BERT, or box embeddings.</p>
<p>The third edition of RepEval aims to foster discussion of the above
issues, and to support the search for high-quality general purpose
representation learning techniques for NLP. Furthermore, we hope to
encourage interdisciplinary dialogue by welcoming diverse perspectives
on the above issues: submissions may focus on mathematical properties of
representations, on analysis of various NLP task performance, as well as
approaches based on linguistic and psychological data. In particular,
experts from the latter fields are encouraged to contribute analysis of
linguistic/psycholinguistic claims previously made in NLP community.</p>
<p>RepEval 2019 will invite submissions including, but not limited to the
following issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>reliable intrinsic measures for task-independent meaning
representations, and their ability to predict downstream task
performance;</li>
<li>approaches for intrinsic evaluation of contextualized and other kinds
of representations;</li>
<li>evaluations motivated with linguistic, psycholinguistic or
neurological evidence, and interpretability of meaning
representations vs evaluation on downstream tasks;</li>
<li>the (un)stability of vector representations, and best practices for
reproducible and reliable experiments;</li>
<li>evaluation of representations at subword level, especially with
regards to morphologically complex languages;</li>
<li>evaluation of phrase, sentence, paragraph and document-level
representations: evidence of compositionality, further diagnostic
tests, and how much the preservation of abstract syntactic
information actually contributes to performance;</li>
<li>alternatives to cosine similarity and vector offsets in
representation evaluation methods;</li>
<li>gauging the effect of representations themselves and other elements
of pipeline in extrinsic task evaluations;</li>
<li>validation of evaluation methodology and findings in cross-lingual
studies;</li>
<li>specialized vs general-purpose representations, and whether the
latter have inherent limits in downstream task;</li>
<li>internal states of end-to-end systems as meaning representations, and
ways to make more sense of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop will accept submissions through three tracks. The <em>proposal
track</em> will showcase proposals for new evaluation techniques for old and
new representations; the submissions are expected to experimentally
demonstrate the benefits of the new approach. The <em>analysis track</em> will
provide critical analysis and/or negative results for the existing
approaches. We welcome both theoretical analysis (especially from
experts in other domains such as linguistics or psychology) and
methodological caveats (reproducibility, parameters, the issue of
attribution of results to the representation or the whole system).</p>
<p>The <em>MultiEval shared task</em> will consist of a “diagnostics challenge”
for word-level models, which would be a combination of intrinsic and
extrinsic methods. Participating systems will be profiled for what kinds
of information they capture as vector neighborhoods (measured by <a class="reference external" href="http://ldtoolkit.space">LDT
library</a>), and how that correlates with their
performance on a suite of downstream tasks. This hybrid
intrinsic/extrinsic approach aims at discovering what intrinsic
properties are actually useful for various tasks, enabling
hypothesis-driven design and tuning of NLP systems.</p>
